Collection of projects/etc from my CS-7b class

Project 1: Recursion exercises

	Completion: ~99%

	Notes: Could come back to clean some things up, but likely will not
    

Project 2: Creating a 3x3 grid of 6-letter words using 2-letter chemical symbols
	
	Completion: ~90%
	
	Notes: Works as expected, but very messy. Needs cleaning up.


Project 3: SFML complex numbers excercises

	Completion: ~99%
	
	Notes: Everything necessary has been completed, and then some. Would like
	to clean some small QOL things up if I have time.


Project 4: Binary Search Tree/Rathof Game
	
	Completion: ~80%
	
	Notes: Basic functionality done, need to document the code and clean up.
	Large amount of redundant code/unused code due to anticipation of expanding
	on the project.
